meshLib - A general purpose library for working with Star Wars Galaxies game client files
========================================================================================

This is a fork of the xunil meshLib project primarily meant as a learning tool for myself as well as to preserve the original code.

Below is a note left in the README.txt by the initial author.

> This is a library I started for the purpose of figuring out the Star
> Wars Galaxies mesh file format.  As I got into it, I started decoding
> more files and never got around to changing the original name of the
> library.  So regardless of the name, meshLib can handle more than
> just the .msh files.  This library is by no means complete.  In some
> cases it will only dump out the data to the console.  I'm still
> decoding file formats so expect this library to change as I figure more
> out.  If you figure out anything thats missing, please let me know so
> I can integrate it into the core code.
> 
> I only work on linux, so the windows build files are very out of
> date.  If any windows developer feels like updating them, let me know
> and I will include the new build files into the package.  I may not
> work in windows, but I try to write cross-platform friendly code.  So
> if you have any portability issues with building under windows let me > know and
> I'll fix the code.
